	  <p>A Onewheel is a one wheeled self balanced electric skateboard. The feeling of riding one is like nothing else. I have been riding Onewheels for almost three years now and it has become one of my greatest passions. The first time I rode one I immediantly knew I had to get one, I started saving and after three months of wokring hard I finally was able to buy one. I love riding my Onehweel and it is one of th emost freeing feelings ever. But not only is the product great but the community surrounding it is what makes it such a fun activity and sport. Anyone you meet that also has a onewheel immediantly becomes your friend and owning one allows you to meet and bonf with so many more people. The commmunity also is filled with kindhearted people and I can proudly say that I sont think its possible for someone to be mean while they are on a onewheel, everyone in the community are amazing kind people and they really make the sport what it truly is. There are tons of different races and competitions for onewheels across the globe taht allow people to compete and trian for onewheeling. I hope someday I can race onewheels and become one of the greats of onewheeling.</p>

	  <p>Bohdi Harrison is a professional onewheeler from california. He has truly pushed the limits of onewheeling and has done things on a onewheel that no one thought was possible. He has invented tricks like the bollie for example, which is a trick that is used by almost everyone in teh onewheeling community. He is one of the members of the factory team taht was created by futrue motion in 2023 so he can continue to push the limits. He has been a hug inspiration for me as I continue to onewheel more and more and get better at it, with his amazing personality and crazy onewheeling skills he has inspired me to get better and hop to become a professional like him.</p>
