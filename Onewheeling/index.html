	  <hr>
	  <p>Bohdi Harrison is a professional onewheeler from california. He has truly pushed the limits of onewheeling and has done things on a onewheel that no one thought was possible. He has invented tricks like the bollie for example, which is a trick that is used by almost everyone in teh onewheeling community. He is one of the members of the factory team taht was created by futrue motion in 2023 so he can continue to push the limits. He has been a hug inspiration for me as I continue to onewheel more and more and get better at it, with his amazing personality and crazy onewheeling skills he has inspired me to get better and hop to become a professional like him.</p>
